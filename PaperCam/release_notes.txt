Real-time Filter Demo
=====================

A Nokia example application demonstrating the use of the Nokia Imaging SDK for
real-time image effects. The effects are applied to the stream received from the
camera and shown in the viewfinder. This app does not support capturing photos. 

This example application is hosted in Nokia Developer Projects:

1. Prerequisites
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- C# basics
- Windows 8
- Microsoft Visual Studio Express for Windows Phone 2012


2. Project structure and implementation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The example consists basically of three key classes. The main page is your
typical phone application page implemented by a XAML file and a C# counterpart.
The main page implements the application UI including the MediaElement which
displays the camera viewfinder with an effect. The MainPage class also owns the
instances of the two other key classes: CameraStreamSource and
NokiaImageEditingSDKEffects. The CameraStreamSource, derived from
MediaStreamSource, provides the camera data. The NokiaImageEditingSDKEffects
implements all the effects of the application.
